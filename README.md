# TweetPress 

Code example for [Build a Twitter bot with AWS lambda serverless framework and node.js]( https://garywoodfine.com/twitter-aws-lambda-bot/) 

## Configuration

In order to generate API credentials you will need to navigate too [Twitter API ](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new)

The config.js is the file you need to store the  API keys in. However,   you do not want to check this file into the public repository. So you should run

`git update-index --no-assume-unchanged config.js
